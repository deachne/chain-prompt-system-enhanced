# Tech Stack Validation Process

## Validation Steps

### 1. Project Requirements Assessment
```
- Scale: [Small | Medium | Large]
- Timeline: [Short | Medium | Long]
- Budget: [Limited | Moderate | Flexible]
- Team: [Small | Medium | Large]
```

### 2. Technology Evaluation
For each technology in the stack:

```
Performance Score = 
    Speed (0-10) * 0.3 +
    Scalability (0-10) * 0.3 +
    Resource Usage (0-10) * 0.4

Reliability Score = 
    Uptime (0-10) * 0.4 +
    Error Handling (0-10) * 0.3 +
    Data Integrity (0-10) * 0.3

Security Score = 
    Authentication (0-10) * 0.3 +
    Authorization (0-10) * 0.3 +
    Data Protection (0-10) * 0.4

Maintainability Score = 
    Documentation (0-10) * 0.3 +
    Community (0-10) * 0.4 +
    Updates (0-10) * 0.3

Cost Score = 
    License Cost (0-10) * 0.3 +
    Hosting Cost (0-10) * 0.4 +
    Maintenance Cost (0-10) * 0.3
```

### 3. Stack Compatibility Check
```
For each technology pair (A, B):
    - Check API compatibility
    - Verify version compatibility
    - Assess performance impact
    - Review security implications
```

### 4. Red Flag Detection
```
Automatic rejection if:
    - Technology is deprecated
    - Critical security issues
    - Poor community health
    - Incompatible licensing
```

## Validation Output

### Stack Score Card
```json
{
    "overall_score": "0-100",
    "category_scores": {
        "performance": "0-100",
        "reliability": "0-100",
        "security": "0-100",
        "maintainability": "0-100",
        "cost_efficiency": "0-100"
    },
    "recommendations": {
        "approved": true/false,
        "concerns": ["list", "of", "concerns"],
        "alternatives": ["suggested", "alternatives"]
    }
}
```

### Alternative Suggestions
If score < threshold, suggest alternatives based on:
1. Higher performance in weak areas
2. Better compatibility with existing choices
3. More suitable for project requirements

## Usage in Chain Commands

```bash
/chain validate-stack [stack-name]
/chain compare-stacks [stack1] [stack2]
/chain suggest-alternatives [category]
```

## Integration with Monitoring

The validation system continuously monitors:
1. New versions and updates
2. Security advisories
3. Community health metrics
4. Performance benchmarks

## Automated Recommendations

The system will automatically suggest:
1. Version updates
2. Security patches
3. Performance optimizations
4. Cost-saving alternatives
